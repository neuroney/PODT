# PVODTE

This codebase is part of the PVODTE paper.

**What this codebase includes**: example and benchmark implementations in C++14 for some of the schemes in the PVODTE paper.

**What this codebase is not**: it is not for production use; it is not extensively tested.

## Setup and Building Instructions

First, install the library [NTL](https://libntl.org/doc/tour-unix.html) required by PVODTE. On several Ubuntu systems this can be done directly through the link above.

To build library and executables:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

To try an example, run e.g.:
```shell
